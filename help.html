  <h1>Do you have a haunting?</h1>
  <h3>Here’s a walkthrough designed to help you determine whether your space might be experiencing paranormal activity.</h3>
  <h2>Step 1 - Initial thoughts</h2>
  <p>
<b>-Take a Holistic View-</b><br>
Start by examining every aspect of your experience. This includes your emotional state, how familiar you are with the location, and whether the site has a reputation for paranormal occurrences. Context matters, so gather as much of it as you can.<br>
<b>-Reconstruct the Event Thoroughly-</b><br>
Even if the moment felt unsettling, try to recall it in vivid detail. The more specific you can be, the easier it becomes to interpret what may have happened.<br>
<b>-Keep a Detailed Log-</b><br>
Begin a journal to track any unusual activity from this point onward. Don’t dismiss minor incidents, they might form a pattern over time. Continue this record for at least four weeks, noting things like shifting objects, unexplained sounds, or strange smells (especially those with a sulfuric or rotten-egg quality).
  </p>
  <h2>Step 2 - Reoccuring phenomena (Document!)</h2>
  <p>
<b>-Sudden Temperature Drops-</b><br>
If you feel an unexplained chill or notice a cold zone in your home, check whether the location has a history of hauntings. Seal off windows and doors, then track temperature fluctuations over time.<br>
<b>-Phantom Footsteps-</b><br>
Unaccounted footsteps can be unsettling. First, eliminate everyday causes like pets or plumbing. If the sounds persist without explanation, consider installing a motion-sensitive camera with audio capture.<br>
<b>-Animal Reactions-</b><br>
Pets avoiding certain rooms or acting strangely? Rule out medical issues with a vet visit. If odd behavior continues, start logging their responses they may be sensing something you can’t.<br>
<b>-Visitor Sensitivity-</b><br>
Pay attention to how guests respond to your space. If multiple people report discomfort or unease, record their impressions. These outside perspectives can help identify recurring patterns.<br>
<b>-Mysterious Scents-</b><br>
Smells like earth, perfume, or sulfur that appear without a source may be worth noting. Track when and where they occur to build a clearer picture of potential activity.<br>
<b>-Children’s Perceptions-</b></br>
Young children may be more attuned to subtle energies. Listen carefully to their descriptions and take note of recurring themes. If their experiences seem distressing, consult a professional.<br>
<b>-Unusual Door or Window Movement-</b><br>
Doors swinging open or windows shifting could be due to drafts or structural quirks. Inspect for physical causes first. If nothing explains the movement, keep an eye out for further anomalies.<br>
<b>-Displaced Objects (Poltergeist Activity)-</b><br>
If items vanish or shift on their own, use trackers or smart devices to monitor their locations. Audio and video recordings can help capture any unexplained movement.<br>
<b>-Unexplained Sounds-</b><br>
Strange noises are often the hardest to verify. Investigate thoroughly, check for pipes, settling wood, or wildlife. If the sounds defy explanation, consider reaching out to an expert.<br>
<b>-Orb Sightings-</b><br>
Capturing orbs in photos? Avoid using flash to reduce dust interference. Observe their motion, erratic flickers suggest particles, while slow, deliberate movement may hint at something more.<br>
<b>-Face-Like Patterns (Pareidolia)-</b><br>
Seeing faces in shadows or images? Our brains are wired to recognize facial features, even when they aren’t there. Before jumping to conclusions, assess the image quality and lighting.<br>
<b>-Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)-</b><br>
If voices emerge from speakers or recorders, try using a voice-activated device to ask simple questions. Review the playback for any unexpected responses.<br>
<b>-Apparition Encounters-</b><br>
Seeing a spirit? Rule out visual illusions or environmental factors. If the presence feels neutral or kind, it may be harmless. If it feels threatening, document everything and seek guidance from spiritual or paranormal professionals.<br>
</p>
  <h2>Step 3 - Be cautious (Try to avoid contact)</h2>
<p>
<b>-Proceed with Care-</b><br>
If you believe you’re encountering a haunting, treat the situation with seriousness and respect. Avoid engaging directly with unknown forces through tools like Ouija boards or séances unless you have deep knowledge and experience. Never attempt such contact while under the influence. Clarity of mind is essential for both safety and credibility.<br>
<b>-Respect the Boundaries-</b><br>
Many accounts suggest that acknowledging spiritual entities can invite them further into your life, potentially escalating activity and triggering fear or paranoia. The well-being of those affected should always come first. For this reason, initiating communication with suspected spirits is strongly discouraged unless under professional guidance.
</p>
  <h2>Step 4 - Submit your documentation</h2>
  <p>
<b>-Submit your evidence-</b><br>
To help us properly assess your report, please provide as much specific information as you can. If available, include any video, photo, or audio recordings that support your account of the haunting.<br>
If you don’t have media evidence, we encourage you to submit a thorough, journal-style record of your experiences. Be sure to note the dates, times, and nature of each occurrence to aid in the investigation. Please keep your documentation as truthful as possible as we take this very seriously.
