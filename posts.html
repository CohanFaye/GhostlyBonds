  <p>Explore our previous investigations and prepare to be part of the thrilling new journeys we're about to embark on. <br>
      Don't forget to swing by each week to catch the latest discoveries we've uncovered.</p>

  <h2>Past investigation</h2>
  <p>
  Every paranormal investigator has had one of those evenings during an investigation.<br>
You’re trying to get a reading on your EMF or attempting to find cold or hot spots with the thermal monitor,<br>
however, you find absolutely nothing.<br>
But you carry on and explore further because you know the history of the location<br>
and you’re determined to find something, anything, to prove that ghosts exist,<br>
to verify to the skeptics that there is life after death.<br><br>

I find indoor locations to be the most interesting.<br>
They’re quiet and enclosed and you can really see everything within your peripheral vision.<br>
What makes it better is that you hear the activity in the other rooms that you can’t visually see,<br>
making the atmosphere feel incredibly eerie,<br>
something that gives paranormal investigators their rush to want more.<br><br>

What a fantastic experience our location was.<br>
It was filled with incredible prepared, determined, and ready investigators,<br>
bringing along the necessary equipment that would surely grab the spirits’ attention.<br><br>

One of the most pivotal moments in the night was the use of the R.E.M Pod.<br>
We had all transferred to the 2nd floor and we had use of 2 bedroom-styled rooms.<br>
We decided to set up equipment in both rooms.<br>
Room one had the R.E.M Pod located in the center of the room,<br>
along with one chair next to the window.<br>
We decided to place the Pod in this location because investigators had past encounters in this room,<br>
feeling the darkness that was located in the corner,<br>
emitting the feeling of being watched.<br>
I must admit, going into that room for the first time made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.<br>
A paranormal investigator’s mind must be prepared to feel all sorts of strange and challenging emotions within a possible haunted area.<br>
I suppose it didn’t help that the building was physically deteriorating,<br>
emulating an already spooky feeling in the room.<br><br>

The second room didn’t have as much of a threatening feeling as compared to the other room,<br>
so we placed a fold-able mirror on the top of the fireplace,<br>
which along with a dim room, allowed the spirits to travel between the two realms much more easily.<br>
I think this gave some of the group a different sense in this room,<br>
but at least the doorway to alternate realms wasn’t near the raging R.E.M Pod.<br><br>

Once everything was in place, we attempted the ‘inverted seance’, a highly used practice,<br>
to try and feel the presence of anything paranormal, either in front or around us.<br>
What made this a credible execution was having all of the investigators facing out whilst standing in a circle holding hands,<br>
you have that knowledge of complete stillness from the group.<br>
Additionally, it eliminates the possibility of the potential breathing on one another<br>
and accidentally thinking it is a spirit passing you.<br>
Everything was in place and we were ready to start contacting the spirit realm.<br>
I could tell some of us were feeling a little uneasy, but we had to push forward.<br><br>

Upon performing the inverted seance, the majority of the investigators felt a sudden increase in temperature,<br>
whereby they were sweating and complaining that it was very hot.<br>
I, on the other hand, didn’t feel this phenomenon.<br>
Could I be the one affected at this point, rather than everyone else in the room?<br>
It was something I definitely considered.<br>
Furthermore, the entire group, including myself, felt extreme dizziness<br>
to the point where we all felt like passing out.<br>
I’m not sure any of us had felt anything quite as powerful<br>
that had the power to affect eight different people all at once.<br><br>

During this session, the R.E.M Pod, located in the other room, consistently reacted to something in the room.<br>
At the beginning of the investigation, we all scanned the area using an EMF reader<br>
to see if there was any intrusion of magnetic fields throughout the entire property,<br>
for which we received absolutely no readings.<br>
Not only that but the property is known to have very little power running through.<br>
At this point in the investigation, I felt as though this could have been one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that we have ever witnessed.<br>
We needed someone to go to that room alone with a camera and record it<br>
as it has been detecting some kind of magnetic field for over ten minutes.<br><br>

Realizing that the R.E.M Pod was reacting so vigorously to our seance in the other room,<br>
we all decided to move on to part two of the experiment,<br>
which was to attempt a ‘human pendulum’ test<br>
in which all investigators except one stand in a circle,<br>
whilst the last group member stands in the middle.<br>
The members creating the circle will ask the spirits (who will respond through the middle member)<br>
to sway the central member in a direction that would determine the word ‘Yes’ and again for the word ‘No’.<br>
I had never taken part in the human pendulum in the past<br>
as I had always gone to explore different areas of past investigations,<br>
so this was new to me and was excited to see how this worked.<br>
The group started the experiment.<br><br>

We found this experiment particularly interesting,<br>
not only was the member in the center of the circle responding to the questions,<br>
but the R.E.M Pod created a different pattern,<br>
which only pulsed after we received answers,<br>
which was fascinating to see as a first-time participant.<br>
We managed to get a clip of the R.E.M Pod reacting to nothing in the room,<br>
however, we were not able to collect enough evidence to show the activity that was being performed in the other room.<br>
Hopefully, in the future, I will be much more prepared to show you that the paranormal does indeed exist.<br>

This property will definitely be one to return to.<br><br>

Take a look at the piece of evidence we have below.<br>
